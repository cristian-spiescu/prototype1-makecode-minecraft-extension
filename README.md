# prototype1-makecode-minecraft-extension

For the moment I don't use this project, because although there is in MakeCode a refresh button next to an extension, it doesn't work well. There seems to be some kind of cache. Modifs that I perform on GitHub aren't seen right away from MakeCode. A couple of tenths of minutes seem to be necessary.

Meanwhile, I'll work via copy/paste.
